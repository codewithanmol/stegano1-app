This is a comprehensive steganography tool built with Python and Streamlit that enables users to hide and extract secret data across multiple media types including images, audio files, video files, text, network packets, and even emojis. The application uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) techniques for media files, zero-width characters for text, and packet header manipulation for network data. It includes optional password-based AES-256-GCM encryption for enhanced security.
